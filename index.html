            Coursegrab is a tool for University of Michigan students to help with building class schedules. It allows you to be notified when a class section that was previously closed (without a waitlist) is open again. This lets students get into the classes they want without needing to constantly check section availability.
        </p>

        <p>
            To be notified when a class opens send a text message to {{ phonenum }} that says
            <strong>subscribe 12345</strong>
            where 12345 is the 5 digit class number found on Wolverine Access.
